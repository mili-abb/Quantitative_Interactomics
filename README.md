# Protein - Protein Interaction Analysis pipeline 

This Python-based pipeline was developed to analyze data from **Native Hold-Up (nHU)** experiments, particularly focusing on the quantitative interactomes of the **SRC** and **HCK** kinases across human and mouse samples. 
It includes modules for data preprocessing, affinity and complexome calculation, comparative analyses between baits and species, and rich visualization capabilities.
